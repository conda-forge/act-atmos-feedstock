  summary: Python library for working with atmospheric time-series by n-dimension datasets

  description: |
    The Atmospheric data Community Toolkit (ACT) is an open source Python toolkit for working 
    with atmospheric time-series datasets of varying dimensions. The toolkit is meant to have 
    functions for every part of the scientific process; discovery, IO, quality control, 
    corrections, retrievals, visualization, and analysis. It is meant to be a community platform 
    for sharing code with the goal of reducing duplication of effort and better connecting the 
    science community with programs such as the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) User Facility.
